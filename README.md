- results are shown here
  - [cluster_analysis.ipynb](./nb/cluster_analysis.md)
  - we try maultple cluster groups [2, 3, 5, 9, 15, 20]
    - the number of cluster groups is always a topic of debate 
    - it depends on the complexity and specificity of the intended analysis 
    - also simplicity is important as simple results are easy to understand 
    - i suggest 5 clusters as a good compromise.
